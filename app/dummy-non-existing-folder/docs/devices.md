# Device registry

Canonical device slugs and their screen resolutions. Use the slug as the
`<device-slug>` folder name and pass the width and height into the device frame. Render
every screen at the exact resolution listed here. Add a device before building screens
for it.

\* The RG28XX uses the 640x480 panel rotated to a 480x640 portrait orientation.

## Resolution classes

Four classes are first-class targets:

- **640x480** 4:3 - the most common SBC handheld panel.
- **1280x720** 16:9 - widescreen devices.
- **720x720** 1:1 - square screens.
- **other** - odd sizes such as 480x320, 720x480, 1024x768 and 1920x1152.

## Adding a device

Add a row above with a lowercase hyphenated slug, the exact panel resolution, the
aspect ratio, and the closest resolution class. The device frame reads the resolution;
it does not need a per-device entry beyond the width and height.
